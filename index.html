                        <h1>The Hitchhiker's Guide to Cape Town</h1>
                        <p>
                            I’ve noticed a certain reluctance to be overly engaging in Cape Town since I first arrived here at the start of 2010. There appeared to me to be a feeling of coolness amongst the people living here. In my initial forays, I approached several locals and “immigrants” from further afield (ie. Joburg, Durban, PE). I was met with confused stares by those who were born and bred Capetonians. Their eyes sought out a hidden motive in my friendly demeanour and unanticipated contact. Those that endured my questions of life in Cape Town for long enough sometimes offered their number, as well as the oft-heard and quoted phrase “Let’s meet for coffee sometime,” before heading off. More often than not, never to be seen or heard from again.
                            Initially, I took this to be nothing more than absent-mindedness or work that kept them busy. However, after four years of living here, I have come to the conclusion that this is simply the socially acceptable way of saying goodbye.
                            If you’ve moved to Cape Town from elswhere in S.A recently, you may find the social dynamics a little bizarre.
                            Honestly, I don’t know why Capetonians are perceived to be a little distant, but I can speculate.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            First off, what is Cape Town like?<br>
                            <br>
                            Cape Town is a kaleidoscopic tapestry. No two areas are the same, and each has its own feeling. Dare I say it... Personality. You literally cannot predict the weather here. One moment you sit at home sweating your nuts off, the next a typhoon blows your scooter moerentoe. Things are never what they seem in Cape Town. Best to keep this in mind when you leave the house, because like the weather, plans shift with equal swiftness.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            12h00: “I’ll see you at three, dude. Cheers.”<br>
                            14h00: “Hey man, why not just come over to mine?”<br>
                            15h00: “You on your way yet? Yeah, no. We were actually thinking of heading over to town. See you there?<br>
                            15h40: “Sorry, not gonna make it. Rain-check?”<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There’s far too much to do in Cape Town. Assuming you can afford to get around. Table Mountain, Kirstenbosch, Stellenbosch, Muizenburg, Long Street. Franschoek and Paarl, Fishoek and Kalk Bay. Drinks at this bar, food at that place, spliff as appropriate.
                            Take your pick. Make your choice. Whatever you will, Cape Town is a cornucopia for those who live life like they’re on vacation.
                            Don’t get me started on the landscapes here. It’s fucken gorgeous pretty much everywhere. Well, except the areas ravaged by the distinct wealth disparity. The Republic of Hout Bay, for example is ringed on either side by two informal settlements, middle to upper-class situated dead-center. You don’t have to do the math to know that’s a recipe for unpleasantness in terms of crime, and yet a potential employment boon.
                            Like the rest of S.A, Cape Town has it’s problems crime-wise, but it’s a cake-walk compared to Joburg. Just don’t break down on the highway at night, and NEVER take the train after dark if you want to live. *Serious Face*
                            If you’re into coffee, craft beer, baked goods and generally behaving like the king of France, you will find Cape Town more than meets your needs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This being said, what of Cape Towns inhabitants and locals?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’m going to say it once, and be done with it:
                            Cliquey is the word, my friends.
                            Something about the combination of things to do and people from all over the world to do it with, I think. If you catch my drift, ahem. In conversation, I have learned that making friends is not so much the point as is “meeting people.” Don’t expect that attractive person you were hitting it off with to get back to you unless you have a foreign accent, or an occupation worth noting.
                            Business in Cape Town is serious, but relaxed. Working hours seem to depend more on the weather and time of year than whether or not work actually needs to be done. Awesome when you’re off. Not so much when you’re waiting for that contractor to call you back. People here are less concerned with what needs doing and more with what can be done without missing out on the party.
                            Posturing is a surefire way to lose face in the icy social conditions that permeate the upper-middle class, as is wearing the wrong articles of clothing in the wrong establishment. Put simply, people dress well here. Maybe it’s something in the water, but there’s a general sense of self-awareness that allows people to be themselves as themselves, if they can hack the intense feeling of judgment that comes along with it. This is true for any city, of course, but particularly in Cape Town. One can really feel the sense of competition with the self and others here.
                            One mustn’t appear to be environmentally uncaring, nor unaware of the proper diet. Cycling is commonplace, as is running, gymming and hiking. Being healthy is cool. At least, I assume it must be, given the virulent spread of “green” stores every three blocks.
                            If you’re clean and green, you’re probably a Capetonian, or you have been assimilated into the collective.
                            A phrase I’ve heard often from Non-Capetonian South Africans living here goes something like this:
                            “I’m from Cape Town. Well, I was born in P.E, but I’ve been living here for twenty years now.”
                            There is an undeniable sense of a desire to be from here. And I think this, more than anything else, defines the social environment in C.T. It activates in the locals a defensive response to the hordes of would-be Capetonians who would otherwise stampede through these lush lands. It’s fair enough when your favourite bar is overrun with drunkards from up north, that you may feel a little cold towards other South Africans. Especially so for those who’ve had to make their way in business and society. It can take years to acquire “Capetonian” status, and the fact is, not everyone can handle the way things work here.
                            Thousands of people move in and out of Cape Town every week. 
                            People come here for work and for travel, for love and adventure, sex and scenic drives. It’s no wonder there’s a wariness of recent arrivals, given their frequency. 
                            One certainly has to exercise a certain amount of discretion when meeting someone new, more so when you’re a woman (which I’m not). Men unabashedly plan their next conquest. Women unashamedly show off their assets. You can feel the sexual tension in the air as you walk into any given bar.
                            Of course, this isn’t always the case. It largely depends on the “mood” of the day. This makes it notoriously difficult for business owners in the bar and restaurant industry to plan ahead. Say it’s a beautiful sunny Saturday. You should be aswarm with revellers. However, say Friday night turned out to be too much for most, and you’re stuck with three solitairy couples and an old man with his dog. Just because it’s pissing with rain right now doesn’t mean you’ll walk into an empty bar later. If the weather clears up, there could be an eager rush for something to do. This makes staffing a nightmare for any business, but particularly those in the service trade. Waiters leave early to enjoy their afternoons, only to be called back as a group from Germany arrives by the busload. All this being said, sunny days in Cape Town are beach days, so either wake up early (07:00) or prepare to drive at mind-numbingly slow speeds along single lane main roads. I’m not saying don’t go to the beach, or that sitting in a rolling oven isn’t fun, but there’s more to Cape Town than just the beach.
                            There are forests. Man, are there forests. 
                            Kirstenbosch Gardens is beautiful, huge and hilly, but guitars are banned, so don’t bother bringing any. Newlands Forest is an open nature reserve nearby, that has no such preposterous rule. Still, both are worth a visit, be ye stoner, jogger, artist or nature lover. Further afield, I’ve found Franschoek and Paarl to be picturesque during the journey and upon arrival. This being Cape Town, it’s all augmented by hundreds of places to eat. Wine farms, markets, bistros, bars & cafes, you name it. Wanna crash somewhere? Backpackers litter Cape Town like plastic bags used to dominate highways. They’re fucken everywhere. If you’re looking for something fancier, wine farms offer lodgings in addition to delicious meals and things... I’m not speaking from experience here, but if the rooms are half as good as their wines, the only thing to worry about is who you’ll be going with.
                            Stellenbosch itself hosts several notable bars that are reminscent in nature and feeling to Pretorian bars. Possibly because many Afrikaans speaking Pretorians make their way there to study at the local university.
